Things to know about MATLAB GUI:

1. For install instructions view README file generated by MATLAB in "MATLAB GUID SOFTWARE" file
2. If you click "Change Base Units" on the main GUI and choose base units (i.e. N and m), then there is no need to add units to loading parameters unless
	the loading parameters unless inputing parameters of different parameters (i.e. chose N-m base units but want to define a moment ft-lb)
3. Must fill out at a minimum "DEFINE SUPPORTS", "CHANGE BASE UNITS" and either "DEFINE POINT LOADS" or "DEFINE DISTRIBUTED LOAD" before being able to
	 view "VIEW INTERNAL FORCE DIAGRAMS" or "CREATE IDEAL BEAM"
4. When viewing "CREATE IDEAL BEAM" must click "plot" to output the 3D model
5. Buttons are not outlined, this is confusing, click words since there are no real "buttons"

Things to know about Excel file:

1. Only change green input cells.
2. You must define either 2 pin supports or 1 fixed support. If using pin supports then leave fixed support input blank and visa-versa.
3. Ready for CAD button exports to a .pts file which must be saved in as points.pts in the folder location ahead of time. The .pts file
	is compatable with Creo Paramtetric.  You can also just go into the points worksheet and grab the outputs for yourself.
4. Equations used to generate the internal stresses due to a hole are shown in worksheet, reference:  Jae-Hoon Kang, “Exact solutions 
	for stresses, strains, and displacements of a rectangular plate with an arbitrarily located circular hole subjected to in-plane bending moment”, 2014
